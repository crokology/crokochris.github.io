This page is intended to provide helpful resources of my research. Most of my current research deals with either Discrete Choice Experiments or Q-methodology. Thus, materials here will be linked to these tools.

### Q-methodology

There are quite helpful resources out there to conduct a Q-study. 

To conduct a Q-study online, there is a neat tool (for free!) to get your data  <a href="https://github.com/aproxima/htmlq">(Aproxima Tool)</a>

For the analysis part, Aiora Zabala wrote a nice R package <a href="https://github.com/aiorazabala/qmethod">'qmethod'</a> to do so.

For people who are not that familiar with R, there is an online tool. Also by Aiora Zabala <a href="https://azabala.shinyapps.io/qmethod-gui/">(qmethod in shiny)</a>

If you would like to know what's going on between the code, I recommend the <a href="https://github.com/aiorazabala/qmethod/wiki/Cookbook">Cookbook</a> or quite humbly an example file that I commented hopefully as helpful as possible <a href="https://raw.githack.com/crokology/QforR/master/Instructions.html">(Link)</a>
