My current research activities are linked to the AgoraNatura project <a href="https://agora-natura.de/">(click here for more info)</a>, in which I am responsible for investigating land managers' preferences for privately financed *Payments for Ecosystem Services* schemes. 

Doing so, I will both apply qualitative and quantitative methods, such as Q-methodology and Discrete Choice Experiments. For the moment being, my PhD dissertation will be built up upon the following three publications:

#### <u>Discrete Choice Experiments informing environmental policies - A systematic review</u>
*Approaching the question of how Discrete Choice Experiments have been used to inform environmental policies, specically the design of Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes. The focus will be set on studies conducted with Ecosystem Services providers and their particular preferences for varying contract attributes.*

#### <u>Stakeholder attitudes towards Payments for Ecosystem Services scheme design</u>
*Using Q-methodology, I will analyse stakeholder attitudes towards institutional design features of Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes to identify factors affecting farmers' uptake of conservation policies.*

#### <u>Institutional design of privately financed Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes</u>
*Conducting a Discrete Choice Experiment survey with German farmers, I will analyse landowners' preferences for the institutional design of privately financed Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes.*
