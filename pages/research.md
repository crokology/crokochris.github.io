My current research activities are linked to the AgoraNatura project <a href="https://agora-natura.de/">(click here for more info)</a>, in which I am responsible for investigating land managers' preferences for privately financed *Payments for Ecosystem Services* schemes. 

Doing so, I will both apply qualitative and quantitative methods, such as Q-methodology and Discrete Choice Experiments. For the moment being, my PhD dissertation will be built up upon the following three publications:

#### <u>Discrete Choice Experiments informing environmental policies - A systematic review</u>
*Approaching the question of how Discrete Choice Experiments have been used to inform environmental policies, specically the design of Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes. The focus will be set on studies conducted with Ecosystem Services providers and their particular preferences for varying contract attributes.*

#### <u>Stakeholder attitudes towards Payments for Ecosystem Services scheme design</u>
*Using Q-methodology, I will analyse stakeholder attitudes towards institutional design features of Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes to identify factors affecting farmers' uptake of conservation policies.*

#### <u>Institutional design of privately financed Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes</u>
*Conducting a Discrete Choice Experiment survey with German farmers, I will analyse landowners' preferences for the institutional design of privately financed Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes.*

### Other research activities
#### <u>Preference analysis for novel contract models in EU agri-environmental policy</u>
Apart from AgoraNatura, I am also involved in the EU project "*Contracts2.0 - Co-design of novel contract models for innovative agri-environmental-climate measures and for valorisation of environmental public goods"*. My contribution here lies within modelling public preference and analysis of perceptions of label-based approaches to stimulate the provision of ecosystem services within the value chain. To achieve this, we will apply Discrete Choice Experiments and Economic Experiments to assess cooperation among farmers and their incentives to do so.  
#### <u>Public preferences for peatland restoration in Scotland</u>
The dissertation of my Master's degree in Ecological Economics dealt with a public preference survey in Scotland, regarding restoration policies of peatlands. I was not involved in the design of the experiment (courtesy of Julia Martin-Ortega, Michela Faccioli and Klaus Glenk), but had the chance to be the first person doing analysis with the data. The focus of my dissertation were peoples time preferencs for peatland restoration and the role of framing effects of how restoration policies are presented to the public.
